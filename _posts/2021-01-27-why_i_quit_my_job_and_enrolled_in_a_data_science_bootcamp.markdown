After years and years of contemplating, I finally quit my job as a Business Analyst and enrolled in an online self-paced data science bootcamp at Flatiron School. I have tried learning data science on my own in the past through different MOOCs, but never really got that far due to repeated cycles of prioritizing work. So, after much thought, weighing out the pros and cons, I decided to fully immerse myself in data science and attempt to make the career switch sooner rather than later.

My role as a Business Analyst did not require much technical skills. Basic Excel skills was sufficient for our data analysis needs. Our department kept it simple. Maybe a little too simple. And to tell you the truth, it got a little boring after a while. Moreover, there was so much data that was yet to be explored. I always wanted to dig a little deeper into the data, but did not know how to. So, after a little online research, I found the art of data science. I came across a lot of cool projects and wanted to get in on the fun!

I have been dedicating around 40 hours a week to the bootcamp and already see myself progressing expotentially in the last 1.5 months. While I did encounter some personal hurdles along the way and ended up having to take a short break, I am more focused that ever to finish the program by this summer.

On a side note, spring semester of my MBA program just started this week, so I am a little nervous about balancing my time with the 2 programs. Time to stock up on red bull!
